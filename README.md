# Lutra â€“ an open source reference implementation

Detailed documentation can be found on our web site: https://ottr.xyz/.

Lutra is our open source reference implementation of the OTTR language available under an LGPL licence. Lutra can read and write OTTR templates and instances on different serialisation formats, and expand instances into regular RDF graphs or OWL ontologies. Lutra is written in Java and is currently only available via a command line interface.
